2025-02-18 20:25:31 | WARNING  | helper:evaluate_article_quality:99 - Invalid rating received: I would rate this article a 3 out of 5.

Accuracy, clarity, and relevance: The article appears to be a library homepage for New England Institute of Technology, listing available services and a call for art submissions. However, the content seems disjointed, with a mix of unrelated topics (game development book) and announcements about computer lab hours.

Rating breakdown:

- Accuracy: 3/5 (the information provided seems mostly accurate, but it's not clear how often this page is updated or if there are any changes to the services listed)
- Clarity: 2.5/5 (the formatting of the text is unclear and hard to read, with long blocks of unformatted content)
- Relevance: 3.5/5 (the relevance to a library homepage seems mostly accurate, but the inclusion of unrelated topics like game development books may be unnecessary)
